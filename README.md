# Project Overview

TLDR Maternal Health is a project that utilizes cloud computing, and natural language processing and hopes to integrate an interactive user interface to provide crucial information to pregnant women. 

# Design
This section shows a visual design of the primary components of TLDR Maternal Health, which are Azure Virtual Machines, a PostgreSQL Database, and Python Transformers.

## Azure Virtual Machines

## PostgreSQL Database

## Docker

## Python Transformers

Originally the proposal suggested using SpaCy for text summarization, but this NLP library didn't have the best precision. The final chosen text summarization technique is a Bart Transformer model that processes slightly slower but generates incredible summaries that take key insights.

# Implementation Instructions

This section provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the project environment.

## Azure Virtual Machines Setup

Instructions: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/monitor-vm-communication

Here are the steps summarized for your implementation instructions section:

1. Create Virtual Machine 1 or Server VM 
- Size
    - Size: Standard B2s
    - vCPUs: 2
    - RAM: 4 GiB
2. Create Virtual Machine 2 or Client VM
- Size
    - Size: Standard B1ms
    - vCPUs: 1
    - RAM: 2 GiB
3. Set up Azure Network Watcher:
   - Understand the role of Azure Network Watcher in monitoring and troubleshooting network communication.

4. Setting up Network Watcher:
   - Navigate to the Azure portal and locate the Network Watcher service.
   - Enable Network Watcher for your Azure subscription and select the appropriate region.
   - Verify that Network Watcher is enabled for the virtual network where your virtual machines reside.

5. Monitoring VM-to-VM Communication:
   - Access the Network Watcher dashboard and select the "VM to VM" option.
   - Choose the source and destination virtual machines to monitor communication between them.
   - Analyze the network traffic flow and troubleshoot any connectivity issues detected.

6. Utilizing Network Watcher Tools:
   - Explore the various tools available within Network Watcher, such as Connection Monitor and Packet Capture.
   - Use Connection Monitor to track network connectivity between virtual machines and diagnose connectivity problems.
   - Employ Packet Capture to capture and analyze network traffic for troubleshooting purposes.

7. Implementing NSG Flow Logs:
   - Enable NSG flow logs for the network security groups (NSGs) associated with your virtual machines.
   - Configure the storage account where NSG flow logs will be stored for analysis.

8. Configuring NSG and Firewall Rules:
   - Define and implement network security group (NSG) rules to control inbound and outbound traffic for your virtual machines.
   - Configure firewall rules to further restrict network traffic and enhance security within your Azure environment.
